# Tapestry Connectors

A collection of custom [Tapestry Connectors](https://usetapestry.com/connectors/). These were created for personal use but if Tapestry adds a way to share them I may do that.

# Connectors

  * `com.letterboxd.activity` adds the activity for a single [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com) user.
    * In the future I would like to authenticate and show the activity of all accounts you follow, a la Mastodon.
  * `com.mlb.scores` adds the scores for completed MLB games for your selected team.
